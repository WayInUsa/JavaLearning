Hello everybody, today we will start first day Java
And here I would like to talk only about java itself.
We might have more videos about intellij idea but in this course we would learn java only.

So Lets start from creating project and package and class
- We will go to source  src folder and would create package named day01_statementsAndComments
- Lets create new Java Class in this finder called TellMeAboutYourSelf
	
	Make sure you will name your class with first capital letter and with camel case!
	Also please try to avoid names like String, System, Print and etc...
	Because it Might be a problem, and you can break your project!
	Camel case is need to make code more readable.
	
	Here we will need to simply print short information about us and of course mention Hello World
	
	Print "Hello, My name is Yurii"
	Print "I live in Chicago"
	Print "I like to write java code"
	
- Lest start so first of all we need to call main method, for now you dont need to know what is this
	we will come back later to it. All what you will need to know for now that we will use main method for a while.
	And inside Main method we will call command System.out.println and pint inside our data.

- Lets create new class PrintVsPrintln
	What is the difference between System.out.println and System.out.print
	All difference is that if you using ln ending than after your text system will go to the new like.
	Like system will click enter if you want to hear it this way.
	Other wise without ln when its just print it would stay at the same line!
	So when we will to print something else it will start printing from same line.

- create new class EscapeSequence
	we also can use EscapeSequence.
	As you can see we are using our text inside double quotes
	so if we would need to use double quotes in our text we must use \" and for single \'
	In order to put backslash \ you can do \\
	Also here is more EscapeSequence for start from new line lige printLn was doing we could use \n
	and for 4 spaces(Tab when you typing) we could use \t

- Lets talk about comments, please create class named CommentExamples
	and lets print here Hello World
	1.So first what I would like to talk its shortcut ctrl+/ (Slash)
	it would coment your line witch was selected or picked and jump to the next line.
	With the same order you can un comment it.
	Also you can select multiple lines like this.
	2. The method of commenting is // here is more methods like /* */ this method will comment all code between comment signs.
	3. another way to comment its /** */ here logic are the same, but you can add instructions in to it.
	Its like small readme for developers
	4.Another method for commenting its //todo: and here you can leave comment in oder to come back to this part.
	This type of comment would give you chance to find it in todo section.
	
	HomeWork
	Create new Class called ShoppingReceipt
	and make sure program can print example bellow:
	Hint -> try to use \t, \n, \", \' you can add comments
