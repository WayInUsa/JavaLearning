How to declare and assign variables

	Variables
	What is a variable
	a container that holds some data
	This helps because we can use those variables/data easily multiple times by using just the variable name
	This helps us be able to change the data/value and from then on the variable value is updated 

	How to declare and assign variables

		dataType variableName; // This is just declaration 
		Ex: int age; 
		1) Data type: kind of data that the variable can hold

		primitive dataTypes:
			whole number: byte, short, int, long, 
			decimal/floating number: float, double
			other: char, boolean

		non-primitive datatype:
			String
			Example above, int is the datatype

		2) Variable name

			Example above, age is the variable name
			The name is how we use/access the data/value inside of it
			Variable names need to be unique. You cannot use the name again. 


	Examples of variables

		int numberOfStudents;
		byte monthNumber;
		short year;


	Declaration and assignment
	Its also possible to declare and assign at the same time
	ex: int students = 200;

	To use a variable's value we use just the variable name

		ex: int students = 200;
		System.out.println(students); // this will print 200
		System.out.println("students"); // this will print student as text
		System.out.println(STUDENTS); // this will give an error because


	Reassigning a variable value

		You can change the value of a variable by reassigning a value 
		int version = 4;
		System.out.println(version);    // this prints 4
		version = 6; 			// reassign version to have a value of 6
		System.out.println(version); 	// this prints 6

DataTypes

	whole numbers: byte -> short -> int -> long

	decimal number: float, double

	characters: char

	boolean: boolean

	Default dataTypes
		whole numbers: int
		decimal numbers: double

		long values: we put L or l to clarify that the number is a long type not an int 

		float values: we put F or f to clarify that the number is a float type not a double
